# Global Warming
#### Use any dataset provided at https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ to visualize, in an effective way, global warming.

Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) temperature datasets contain monthly mean temperature, monthly maximum temperature and monthly minimum temperature. The station network for the time being, is 7280 stations(meteorological stations). In this case the dataset to be used is the one containing the monthly mean temperature and whose data have been adjusted by the developers of the dataset. 
The dataset is available at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/csv/.
